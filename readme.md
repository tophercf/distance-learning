# CS171 Final Project

Project Title: Who Benefits from Distance Learning?  
Goal: To explore the impact of distance learning in education and the dynamics of key education providers in this space.   
Motivation: With the rise of online courses, many educational institutions have expanded or started a distance learning option. We would like to explore how distance learning has impacted institution success and resulting student outcomes.
