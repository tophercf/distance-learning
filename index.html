                        <p>
                            Over the span of 2012-2016, the number of institutions that added remote learning
                            opportunities
                            increased by X%. This is an unprecedented shift into alternative learning and based on the
                            trend, it's here to stay.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This trend towards increased remote learning and the ability to take course work from high
                            quality institutes that were previously out of reach due to academic grades or money can
                            also
                            be inferred based on supply side consequencies of this trend.
                            Smaller universities with less prestige are closing at a faster rate, unable to take in the
                            revenues that were previously available due to georgraphic constraints of some students.
                            With a
                            superior complimentary good, we are already seeing consolidation in the market.
                            Moodies predicts this consolidation will continue to force the small universities to close
                            or
                            merge into larger units in order to survive, leading to closures triple of years past.

                            Despite an overall increase in online learners, not all strata of society are seeing proportional growth in participation. Between 2012 (blue) and 2016 (orange), low- and high-earning graduate and undergraduate students saw dramatic shifts.
